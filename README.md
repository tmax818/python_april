```py
# TODO write a join sql query to get a user and all its books

# TODO the query will be a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary will contain all the attributes of the user and one of the user's books.

# TODO create an instance of the user class that will have the books attribute. The attribute is a list of all that user's books: user.books

# TODO loop over the list of dictionaries returned from the database.

# TODO create a dictionary to hold and format the book's data from each dictionary.
# TODO append `books.`to the attributes where needed:

# TODO once the dictionary is created for each books, append it to the books attribute list. Inside the append method, convert the dictionary created in the previous step to an instance of the book class.
 
# TODO finally, return the user created above. It will contain the books attribute created in the for loop above.
